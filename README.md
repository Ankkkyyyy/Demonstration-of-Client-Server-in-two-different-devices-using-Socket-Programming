# Guide for Project Demonstration 

So Let me clarify the story here how it is going to work.
You will be running the Server Side in your mobile or any other device in any compiler & your Client side that will be having a GUI too that will be running in your Laptop. 
### So for connecting both the device their will be 3 major requirements that you must know & you have too full fill to connect both of them.

#### 1)	To Make sure that both are connected to Same LAN Network. 
#### 2) To have the IP address of the Server side & as must the port must be same. as we are running on 2 different devices so we will be needed IP address of Server side.
#### 3) After all this we must make sure that we are running Server Side first and then Client side.
